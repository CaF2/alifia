# Alifia

This is supposed to be a general purpose gnu make library.

## Alifia already includes

* Arithmetics
* A root-dir finder
* Check target of other makefiles.

## TODO

* Pre made helper targets, for making .o files in another directory?
* Double and integer arithmetics, currently its all about doubles?
* Add advanced stuff like multiline code, or to execute code from other language?
